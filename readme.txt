= I enabled the plugin, but nothing shows =

The plugin generates the code, but it needs you to customize and add you own icon images.
This is an example of css with 27x27px icon images:
`/*
 * ASIDE-SOCIAL PLUGIN
 */

.widget_aside_social {
	display: block;
	width: 188px;
	height: 30px;
	margin: 20px auto 20px auto;
}

.widget_aside_social div:hover {
	margin-top: -3px;
	margin-bottom: 3px;
}

.widget_aside_social div {
	float: left;
	display: block;
	width: 27px;
	height: 27px;
	background: url(img/top-icons.png);
	margin: 0 10px;
}

.widget_aside_social div a {
	display: block;
	width: 27px;
	height: 27px;
}

.widget_aside_social .twitter {
	background-position: -11px -11px !important;
}
.widget_aside_social .facebook {
	background-position: -60px -11px !important;
}
.widget_aside_social .rss {
	background-position: -109px -11px !important;
}
.widget_aside_social .mail {
	background-position: -158px -11px !important;
}`

In future versions I will add a default-css code option so you don't need to touch anything.
